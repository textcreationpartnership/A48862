            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I firſt obſerv'd, how ſuddenly the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hereſie</hi> ſpread it ſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nation, I could not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf, without making ſome Enquiry, how it came to paſs, which I no ſooner did, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that <hi>Pretences,</hi> either to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> were not indeed the true Cauſe thereof ſo much as the <hi>Induſtry, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>Deceitful Methods</hi> of the <hi>Hereſiarchiſts,</hi> who, being themſelves ſtruck Blind by the Divine Glory, which ſhines in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of our Holy Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:104460:3"/>and hardened alſo through the Innate Averſion, that is in us by Nature, unto the Self-abuſing Truths in the Goſpel, have made it their Province to pervert ſuch, whom they found pliable to how down to the Idol of a Religion of their making.</p>
            <p>Some of their Methods I have detected, in the Enſuing <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;</hi> and, if God give leave, may do more hereafter. I have traced out ſome Foot-ſteps, in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party, conducing towards the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cauſe, and am ſorry to ſee how many, among the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> by their Heats, and Indiſcretions, have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted too much toward the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Errour, as well as they, that have run to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Extreme in their oppoſing
<pb facs="tcp:104460:3"/>
               <hi>Socinian,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Whether, in Imitation of the <hi>Italian Combinators,</hi> there are any amongſt us have joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> with a Deſign to ſubvert the <hi>Truths,</hi> they profeſs to own, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Contrary they pretend a Zeal againſt, I will not ſay: But this will I ſay; that, tho' my Charity to Men, whoſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> are very different from what I hold (who I believe <hi>ſincere,</hi> and open in their <hi>Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations</hi>) is by many, that know me, obſerv'd to be of a <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> as they think, to a Fault; yet, not being able to abide any of theſe <hi>Hypocritical,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Trickings,</hi> in Matters Religious, which, to my great
<pb facs="tcp:104460:4"/>Sorrow I ſee now, tho' formerly I could not believe, I ſhall, for the unburthening my Conſcience, and for the ſake of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwary, ſhow, that there are ſundry <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> advanced by Men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, among the ſound in the Faith, that do, in ther <hi>Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> leade to what theſe drive, who are of the worſt Sort, that is, the <hi>Engliſh Socinians.</hi> And that my Impartiality may appear, as I have not, ſo will I not forbear to expreſs my juſt Indignation againſt thoſe <hi>Antinonian</hi> Dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with their Miſchievous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which have been, not only an Inlet to a looſe Life, but the Occaſion of hurrying ſo many into that wicked <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I do, as I intend, this, I deſire to be found one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <head>OF THE GROWTH OF ERROR.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>GREAT and Pernicious Errors having been inſenſibly ſpread through this Nation, an Account of their Riſe, and Progreſs, and of the various and ſundry Methods which have been taken for their Propagation, will not, I preſume, be unneceſſary; but rather a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to young Students, a prevention of their Fall, if not a means to recover others, that have been already tainted.</p>
               <p>And, that I may be the more clear and diſtinct in the Account I give, I muſt, in the firſt place, mention the Errors my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is of. For, though there is a great Cognation and Alliance between one Error and another, and the moſt oppoſite Hereſies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104460:6"/>at laſt, center in the ſame Point: Yet on an eaſie ſearch, we ſhall find vaſt Differences between them, ſome greater, others leſs; ſome in one, others in a contrary extream: But, in all, a Tendency to <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> or, to uſe the new and finer word to expreſs the ſame thing, <hi>Deiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there are gradual Receſſes from Truth, the firſt, and leaſt obſervable <hi>Turn</hi> from it, prepares the way for a greater; but whilſt near unto Truth, the <hi>Error</hi> is ſo like it, that it cannot be eaſily diſcern'd, or detected: And he, who makes the firſt ſtep towards it, doth, er'e he is aware, ſlide into a greater; and no ſooner perceives where he is, but thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too far gone to make an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; whereby the Error which had it's firſt riſe from <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> is upheld, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Luſt, or ſenſual Intereſt of its Embracers.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Amyraldians,</hi> amongſt whom, they who are ſincere in what they Profeſs, as I doubt not, but there are many ſuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee wherein they differ from their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, except in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and Defending the ſame Doctrine; and therefore aſſume to themſelves the Title of <hi>New Methodiſts, firmly adhering to old Truths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, of theſe, how many ſlide into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm?</hi> and from thence paſs over unto the Tents of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ocinus:</hi> Though they ſet up for Men of a <hi>middle way,</hi> between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Exceſſes of <hi>Van Harmine;</hi> yet, on the turn from the former,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104460:6"/>they fall in ſo far with the latter in their Conceſſions, that it's become impoſſible for them to make a juſt Defence of what they hold in oppoſition to the other Parts of the <hi>Arminian Syſtem;</hi> and therefore at laſt, fall in entirely with them, and run their length.</p>
               <p>In like manner the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a <hi>middle way</hi> between the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Socinian,</hi> are in the twinkling of an Eye, fallen under <hi>Socinus</hi> his Banner; confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holy Scripture with their odd Gloſſes, and unintelligible Interpretations; framing Idea's of the Divine Being, ſo unworthy of it, as to provoke ſome to <hi>deny all reveal'd Religion,</hi> and others to turn <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>progreſs</hi> of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Errors, embracd and propugnd by the followers of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> that my Diſcourſe is deſign'd to be of. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which, above Fifty years ago, on their firſt appearances amongſt us, ſo alarm'd the Nation, as to put it into a very terrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion.</p>
               <p>But ſince that day, through the force of an <hi>Arminian Doſe,</hi> or ſome ſuch like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, we have fallen into an <hi>Amazing</hi> ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and no ſooner doth any one awake out of it, but he is fill'd with wonder to behold the Nation to be ſo much <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Deiſt;</hi> Nor can he eaſily <hi>imagine how</hi> it came to be ſo?</p>
               <p>And, that we may obtain ſome Light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what it is, that hath influenced ſo great a part of Mankind to embrace theſe Errors; I have ſpent ſome thoughts about it, the Reſult of which, I offer to Conſideration.</p>

               <p>When therefore, in our <hi>Syſtems,</hi> they meet with what tranſcends their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they reject it as Falſe, Abſurd and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
               <p>This was the way of the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> touching the Doctrine of particular Election, Reprobation, Irreſiſtible Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> about Chriſt's ſatisfaction; the Incarnation of the Son of God; the Bleſſed Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of the <hi>Deiſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reveal'd Religion; who by a Late Ingenious Author, in the Account he gives

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible Doctrine</hi> be revealed? Not to inſtruct, but to <hi>puzzle,</hi> and <hi>amuſe.</hi> What can be the effect of an <hi>

               </p>
               <p>But what doth this ſignifie leſs, than that whatever tranſcends our Underſtandings, and is above our Reaſon, is an Abſurdity, an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible Doctrine, fit only to puzzle and amuſe, and the belief thereof Irrational; ſo that, if they can't frame an <hi>Adequate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> or comprehend the whole of what their thoughts are converſant about; if they can't reduce every thing to their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived order, and know it to perfection, it cannot in their opinion be true, but muſt, you ſee, be rejected as Abſurd, Falſe, and Irrational.</p>
               <p>Though nothing more manifeſt and clear, than that the moſt enlarged Create Mind is Finite, Confin'd and Limited, and that there is a Being whoſe Eſſence and Perfections are Boundleſs, Unconfin'd, Incomprehenſible,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104460:8"/>and paſt finding out; and that it's impoſſible, and a contradiction to ſuppoſe a Finite Mind, able to comprehend what is Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, or to get to the uttermoſt Bounds and Limits of what is Boundleſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitable; yet with theſe Men the notion of a Deity, if we aſſign unto it Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, though eſſential thereunto, muſt be rejected, that is, they will believe nothing of God, unleſs they may take him to be ſuch another as themſelves, or themſelves ſuch as He is, as to the extent of his Being; nor muſt any things be received into our Religion as true, that ſpeak of his Tranſcendency, but muſt be eſteemed as falſe and irrational, which amounts to thus much, <hi>nothing in</hi> theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>muſt be believ'd to be true, but what is impoſſible to be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, to an unbyaſſed mind, its moſt evident that there is a God, with whom are the <hi>Secrets</hi> of Wiſdom,<note place="margin">Job 11.7.</note> whoſe Being by ſearching cannot be found out, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known to Perfection? And that the <hi>Life</hi> of true Religion lyeth in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>this God;</hi> and ſeeing an Adequate <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which is the ſame with a knowing to Perfection, is impoſſible, and yet there can be no true Religion without ſome knowledge of God; the inference is <hi>Manifeſt, Natural</hi> and <hi>Eaſie,</hi> viz. That we may attain to a knowledge of God according to Truth, tho' we can't have an Adequate and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge of him, and that it's not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay, we can't comprehend it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not true.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104460:8"/>
               <p>The moſt Momentous parts then of true Religion, being about the Perfections of God; ſuch as his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as diſtinct from his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the unchangeableneſs of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like, muſt be above our Reaſon too, and yet may be true: The ſame may be ſaid of the Bleſſed Trinity and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God; which are not more Tranſcendent and Incomprehenſible than what we find to be ſaid of the Eſſential Perfections of his Nature; nor is there any thing more difficult, and inſcrutable in what is reveal'd about the Eternal Decrees, and the Modes of Divine Operation, than there is in the Doctrine of the Trinity, or Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and therefore our belief of them equally Rational.</p>
               <p>Well then, if the points in Controverſie between us are all reduced to one, or other of theſe heads, as really they are, for either to the Glorious Attributes, Perſonalities, Decrees or Modes of Divine Operations; the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son, the neceſſity of a proper ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Juſtice, and thoſe other points about Election, Reprobation, Irreſiſtible Grace, are reducible; a rejecting theſe Doctrines, becauſe there is ſomewhat in them, exceeding the utmoſt extent of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Unſearchable; or, which is the ſame becauſe there is ſomewhat <hi>Myſterious</hi> in them, muſt be upon a reaſon, that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obliges us to caſt off the Belief of a Deity.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104460:9"/>
               <p>Beſides, the Grand Maxim of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who pretend ſo much to Reaſon, being, as I have already noted, this; <hi>that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be received into our Religion as true, but what we can Comprehend;</hi> a ſpice of the firſt ſin muſt be at the bottom, as the cauſe of all their Errors; namely, an ambition to <hi>be like</hi> unto God, in his eſſential Perfections; which, in good earneſt, is the import of this Maxim; for it's impoſſible for them to know God to Perfection, unleſs the extent of their Underſtandings bears a proportion to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: So that in the iſſue, they cannot fairly deny the myſteries of our Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but on a Topick, whereby they make themſelves equal with God.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that by oppoſing our Holy Religion, for the ſake of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> there are in it; they are driven either to the denyal of a God, or to the making themſelves Gods; either of which is, of all Abſurdities, the moſt vile and groſs.</p>
               <p>But to follow the <hi>Deiſt</hi> in his way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing: He makes a <hi>Myſtery</hi> to be an <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Doctrine,</hi> that can only puzzle and amuſe, becauſe in it there is ſomewhat above our Reaſon; whereas it's very clear, that the Doctrine may have ſomewhat <hi>unſearchable</hi> in it, and yet be intelligible enough; thus when it's ſaid Man's underſtanding is Finite, but God's is Infinite, I clearly and diſtinctly enough perceive the meaning hereof, and have as good reaſon to believe God's to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> as I have that Man's is Finite; and tho' there is ſomewhat included in Infinity, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104460:9"/>is above my Reaſon, yet the Revelation, which ſaith, that the Divine Underſtanding is Infinite, and unſearchable, is to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> and not to puzzle or amuſe.</p>
               <p>Once more, ſeeing God, whoſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Infinite, in creating all things, hath left ſuch impreſſes of his Infinity on the things Created, that the profoundeſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, in his Cloſeſt ſearches into their Nature, ſees enough to conclude, there is ſomewhat in them, unſearchable, and paſt finding out, which to me is an uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument, that an Infinitely wiſe Agent is their Maker: Even ſo, when I read the Holy Scriptures, look into the Doctrines therein contained, there are ſuch clear and diſtinct Revelations of ſundry Glorious <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> touching infinite Wiſdom, and the other Divine perfections, that I cannot but with ſtrongeſt Aſſurances conclude, that God is their Author too.</p>

                  <note place="margin">pag. 33.</note> concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> doth, I confeſs, hope to extricate himſelf out of this difficulty; by diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>things themſelves</hi> and the <hi>manner of them;</hi> affirming, that the things themſelves, that is, God's Eternity, Infinity, Omnipreſence, are intelligible, but the <hi>manner</hi> of them is impoſſible to be apprehended. <q>The <hi>Idea</hi>'s (ſaith he) we have of God's <hi>Eternity, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Omnipreſence, Omniſcience,</hi> and all that we are required to <hi>believe</hi> concerning them, are ſo clear and diſtinct, that an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104460:10"/>Capacity apprehends what we mean, when we ſay, God is Eternal, Infinite, Omniſcient, Omnipreſent, though theſe <hi>things themſelves</hi> are intelligible, yet the <hi>manner</hi> of them is impoſſible to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and as we are now framed, we are not capable of having it revealed to us; and none but a blind <hi>Metaphyſician,</hi> who pretends to know all things, but really knows nothing, would be ſo vain, as to attempt to explain the <hi>manner</hi> of God's Omnipreſence, or his Omniſcience. It is no wonder there are inſuperable difficulties about the <hi>manner</hi> of things of this Nature, when there are as great difficulties in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the <hi>manner</hi> of Nature's Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the moſt common things, which things none disbelieveth, becauſe he does not apprehend <hi>how</hi> they <hi>are done.</hi> Who disbelievth there is ſuch a Creature as Man, though he does not know how he was formed? But it is quite otherwiſe when we cannot <hi>apprehend the things themſelves,</hi> there is then an abſolute <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A perfect Idea of the things themſelves, that is, of Eternity, Infinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (he ſaith) we may have, but not of the <hi>manner;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the Reaſon, why we can't have a <hi>perfect Idea</hi> of the <hi>manner</hi> of Infinity, Eternity, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> can be no other, than what makes it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have an Adequate Idea of Infinity, Eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>things</hi> themſelves; it cannot be more poſſible to apprehend <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> than the <hi>manner</hi> of it. And it's manifeſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104460:10"/>that the difficulty of apprehending the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> ariſes from <hi>its Infinity,</hi> we cannot have a perfect Idea of the <hi>manner</hi> of Eternity, becauſe of the Infinity is in it; and as we can't comprehend <hi>how</hi> God is Eternal, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we have a perfect Idea of <hi>Eternity.</hi> It's true, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Eternity, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is intelligible, we know what we mean when we diſcourſe of Eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then muſt add, that we mean by Eternity ſomewhat with reſpect to duration that exceeds the Bounds of the moſt enlarged Create underſtanding, of which we cannot have a perfect Idea.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Diſtinction</hi> then between the <hi>things themſelves,</hi> and their <hi>manner</hi> is in this Caſe inſufficient to ſolve the difficulty; for there is as much of Infinity in the <hi>things themſelves,</hi> as is in <hi>their manner,</hi> and therefore equally above our Reaſon; and the impoſſibility to frame a perfect Idea of either, is the ſame. The <hi>Nature of God,</hi> is as <hi>unſearchable,</hi> as his <hi>ways are paſt finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, if we apply this diſtinction to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Idea we have of a <hi>Perſon</hi> in the Bleſſed Trinity, is as Intelligible as any one of the Divine Attributes; and that the difficulty, in Controverſie is about the <hi>manner how three perſons</hi> can be in the <hi>unity</hi> of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not in the <hi>things themſelves.</hi> A Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons is as intelligible, as a <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> of Attributes, and the <hi>manner</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating a variety of Attributes, with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſimplicity, is as impoſſible as the conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104460:11"/>a Trinity of Perſons with Unity of Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The Error, therefore of theſe Men, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their inſinuating that it's not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have a perfect Idea of Eternity, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Omniſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but of their <hi>manner,</hi> when as the one and the other is equally impoſſible, and that touching the Trinity, the Controverſie is not about the <hi>manner,</hi> but the thing <hi>it ſelf;</hi> and yet nothing more evident than the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> to wit, the Trinity hath nothing more inſuperable in it, than a variety of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and that in reality the objections are in this Caſe raiſed from the <hi>manner</hi> of the thing, not from the <hi>thing it ſelf:</hi> It is about <hi>how</hi> it can be, not <hi>what</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>Another therefore is more bold, averting, that he can comprehend Infinity, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is truly predicated of God; but not being able to comprehend the <hi>Trinity,</hi> it cannot be true; whereby his own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not only made the meaſure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths; but according to what I have already ſuggeſted, he himſelf made equal with God, or the Infinite God made ſuch another as himſelf.</p>

               <p>And when I read in the Writings of ſome Men, who, in Reaſoning about other things, are ſtrong and nervous, yet weak and feeble in their arguings againſt the profound Myſteries of Chriſt's Goſpel; I cannot but clearly perceive a <hi>Truth</hi> in thoſe words of the Apoſtle,; <q>

               <p>This they found to be a Notion, as plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as it was to their Corrupt Minds agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and becauſe the Orthodox, who preſſed a Holy Life and Converſation as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, could not put their own Obedience into the place and room of Chriſt's, it hath been the common practice of the Erroneous to reproach them as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Holyneſs and Mortification; as tho' they held, that we might live as lewdly as we liſted, and die as we lived, yet in the end obtain Salvation through the Death and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>

And that he might enter on the Execution of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office,</hi> whereby he doth all things which belong to the Salvation of the Elect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and freeing them from all Evil, and at length making them meet for the partaking of Spiritual and Heavenly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: He did, by rendring Obedience to

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this, <hi>Przipcovius</hi> being aware, he roundly aſſerts, That Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, in a <hi>proper</hi> Sence, and truly Man, but not at the ſame time; when on Earth, he was properly Man, and after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and not till then <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> God.

                  <p>Nor are they more happy in their <hi>Morals,</hi> for (beſide their Hypocriſie) their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſecret Aſſiſtances, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of God's fore-ſeeing all future Events, that depend upon the freedom of Man's Will, (as a very learned Perſon hath lately

                     <q>I do publickly preach to a numerous Auditory, and frequently diſpute when my Reverend Collegues are preſent, at which times I have uſed the greateſt freedom, in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I have return'd to Objections: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I have a private <hi>College,</hi> at which thirty Students, or more attend; and yet never hath there been the leaſt mention, that I ever uttered any thing contrary to the Holy Scriptures, or our Confeſſions, and Catechiſm; although ſome of my Collegues, whoſe Zeal is ſuch for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Doctrine, that they would never have been ſilent, had they whereof to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, have been inſtigated thereunto. And whereas it's ſpread abroad, that I direct my Pupils to Read the Writings of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Coornhertius,</hi> the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſo groſs, that I cannot find ſofter Words to expreſs it by, than to ſay, <hi>It is a down right Lye,</hi> for I never advis'd ſo much as one to any ſuch thing. But this indeed I do, after the Reading of the Scriptures, which I do moſt earneſtly preſs, yea more than any other, as the whole A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy can teſtifie, I do direct to the reading of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries,</hi> which I praiſe much more than <hi>Helmichius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

For I do eſteem them to <hi>excell all others ſo much in the Interpretation of Scriptures,</hi> that there <hi>are none to be compared with them,</hi> in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> that there was a more excellent Spirit in him than in any other: As for <hi>Common Places,</hi> I Recommed his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> to be read af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> as containing the beſt Explication of it.

I will give you what he ſaith touching <hi>the Grace of God in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of <hi>a Sinner</hi> in the <hi>ſight of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>What concerns the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> I do, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, (ſaith he) believe it to be that gracious and free Affection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth take pity on a miſerable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by which he doth, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, <hi>give his Son,</hi> that whoever believes in him, may have Everlaſting Life; then doth he <hi>juſtifie</hi> him, and give him the Privilege of a Child by Adoption, even
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104460:31"/>a <hi>Right</hi> to Salvation. 2. <hi>This Grace</hi> is an infuſion of all the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are for the Regenerating, and renewing of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> as well as <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> ſuch as Faith, Hope, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without which Gifts of Grace no Man is able to <hi>Think, Will,</hi> or <hi>Do</hi> any good thing. 3. It is the continued Aſſiſtance, and help of the Holy Spirit, according unto which the Holy Ghoſt does <hi>excite</hi> and ſtir up the Regenerate unto Good, by infuſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Spiritual and Heavenly Thoughts, inſpiring them with good Deſires, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them actually to Will that which is good; yea more, according to this Grace, the Spirit doth Will, and work with the Man, that what he Wills, he may be enabled to Perfect. After this manner I aſcribe unto Grace, the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Continuation,</hi> and <hi>Conſummation</hi> of all Good, even ſo far, that a <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Man without this <hi>Preventing, Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> Continued, and Co-operating Grace, can never think, will, or do any good, nor reſiſt the feebleſt Temptation to Evil. <hi>How then can I be ſaid to be injurious to the Grace of God,</hi> or attribute too much to free Will? The Controverſie is not about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or Operations aſcribed to Grace; I am for as much as any Man whatſoever; but it is only about the <hi>Mode,</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>its Oprations,</hi> whether it be by an <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible</hi> Force, or not? Here, indeed, I do with the Holy Scriptures, hold, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104460:32"/>many reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, and reject the offer'd Grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his Letter to <hi>Hypolitus à Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> 
                     <q>Concerning Grace, and free Will, according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and conſent of the Orthodox, I do declare, That <hi>Free Will</hi> without Grace, can neither begin, nor perfect any true Spiritual good Work, and leaſt any think I do (as <hi>Pelagius</hi> did) play with the Word, <hi>[Grace]</hi> I mean <hi>that Grace,</hi> which is the Grace of Chriſt, and belongs to Regeneration; which I hold to be <hi>ſimply,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the inlightning the Underſtanding, regulating the Affections, and inclining the Will to what is good, that infuſes ſaving Light into the Mind, inſpires the Affections with Holy Deſires, and boweth down the Will to act according to that ſaving Light, and theſe good Deſires. This Grace, Prevents, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Accompanies, and Follows; It ſtirreth up, helps, and works, that we may Will; and that we may not Will in vain, Co-operates with us. It ſecures us from Temptations, Aſſiſts, and helps us againſt them, upholding us againſt the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil. In the Conflict it gives us the Victory, and if at any time, we are overcome, and fall in the Temptation, this Grace recovers us, eſtabliſhes and gives new Strength, making us more watchful. It begins the Work of Salvation, promoves, perfects, and conſummates it. The mind of a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104460:32"/>Carnal Man, is, I confeſs, dark'ned, his Aſſections vile and inordinate, his Will diſorderly; yea, he is <hi>dead in Sin,</hi> and that Preacher is moſt highly eſteemed by me, who attributes <hi>moſt</hi> to <hi>Grace,</hi> if ſo be, that, whilſt he is extolling Grace, he doth neither Impeach <hi>God's Juſtice,</hi> nor take from Man <hi>Free Will</hi> to <hi>what is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>

                     <q>That Chriſt, by his Obedience, and Righteouſneſs, is the <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe of Juſtification, who may therefore be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly called <hi>the Procatartick Cauſe.</hi> The ſame, Chriſt in his Obedience and Righteouſneſs is alſo the <hi>Material</hi> Cauſe of our Juſtification, that is, as God gives to us Chriſt for Righteouſneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes his Obedience and Rignteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; in reſpect to this double Cauſe, namely, the <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and <hi>Material,</hi> we are ſaid to be conſtituted Juſt, or Righteous, by Chriſt's Obedience.</q>

The firſt is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his Obedience; the other is Chriſt for Righteouſneſs; Chriſt Given, and his Righteouſneſs Imputed. He was too Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confound the Material, and Intrinſick with the Meritorious, which is an External, and <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe, aſſerting, that as Chriſt is the Meritorious Cauſe, ſo he, as an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> juſtifieth us by his Righteouſneſs: As he is the <hi>Material,</hi> he is given by God for Righteouſneſs, and his Righteouſneſs is imputed to us for Juſtification.</p>

For <hi>Homnius</hi> in his <hi>Specimen</hi> Quotes <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> for denying, that we can attain unto the knowledge of God by the Light of Nature, which is a Notion advanced by <hi>Socinus;</hi>

                  <p>To this <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> doth <hi>Satyrically</hi> enough reply, charging <hi>Homnius</hi> for being a <hi>Falſarius,</hi> who not only perverted his ſenſe, but <hi>changed</hi> his very words, putting into his corollary, <hi>[Naturalis]</hi> inſtead of <hi>[Salutaris.]</hi> This charge, (if true) being ſo very high, I could not ſatisfie my

                  <p>This third Corollary, ſuppoſing the knowledge of God to be <hi>Natural,</hi> cannot without a too ſevere Reflection on <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> his underſtanding, be taken as <hi>Homnius</hi> hath Repreſented it; for, as it's thus, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be, <hi>whether the knowledge of God had from Nature, be Natural?</hi> whereby as the queſtion is it ſelf an abſurdity, ſo the denyal carries in it a contradiction, as groſs as that Light is not Light; that what is from Nature is not Natural, can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no leſs than that what is Natural is not Natural. But to hold that the knowledge of God, which is from Nature is not <hi>ſaving,</hi> is a truth aptly enough expreſs'd, and what the Remonſtrants profeſs to be for, as I hope on another occaſion more fully to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> diſpoſition towards the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is too manifeſt to admit of doubt, and there is much more ſaid by <hi>Homnius, Bodecherus, Peltius, Vedelius,</hi> and many others, about their Agreement in Principles, than hath been fully anſwer'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104460:42"/>either by <hi>Grotius, Epiſcopius,</hi> or any other that I have met with.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Applauſes given the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants by the <hi>Socinians:</hi> and the numbring them amongſt the ſupporters of their <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> with the Remonſtrants declining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; the Reaſons why they do ſo; their ſetting them in a higher Claſs than the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and maintaining Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them amongſt the Mennoniſts, ſets it above all Diſpute.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I add out of <hi>Bogermanus</hi> his Notes, on the defence of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> and the Remonſtrants,<note place="margin">Praef. Lib. de Authorit.

                  <p>What therefore hath been urg'd by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Epiſcopius</hi> or others, in defence of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> or by <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> himſelf to throw off the charge of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> doth ſerve only to convince us of the Hypocriſie of the Man, and that according to the fears of ſome of his <hi>Socinian Friends,</hi>

                  <p>However, the Doctrine of Three. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Subſtances hath been, not only Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly as well as ſharply charged with <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm;</hi> but Condemned for being <hi>Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Heretical.</hi> I will therefore, it lying ſo much in my way, venture, humbly to Offer what inclines me to Conclude, that this turning the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> into <hi>Three Eſſences</hi> is Heretical. For tho I am far from Hereticating every one that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from me in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Moment;</hi> or from making every Erroneous Explication of a Fundamental Article to be Hereſie; yet I am perſwaded, that the Doctrine of the Trinity of Perſons in one undivided Eſſence is of ſuch a Nature; that many, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating it, have fall'n into divers Hereſies; and that thus it is in the Preſent Caſe.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine condemned for Heretical is a makeing the <hi>Perſons</hi> in the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be <hi>Three Dictinct Subſtances,</hi> or <hi>Individual Natures;</hi> which is as Direct a Contradicton to the <hi>One</hi> Intire, and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Nature</hi> of God, as can be. Three Individual Eſſences are as much Oppoſed to one Individual Eſſence, as Three Perſons are to one Perſon; and Three Perſons may be as well One Perſon, as three Individual Eſſences be one Individual Eſſence.</p>

                  <p>The Author therefore of this Notion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in Reaſon, be ſuppoſed to Believe theſe Contradictory Propoſitions to be both true: and being ſo vehement in his Aſſerting Three Individual Natures as to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial thereof to be <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Nonſence,</hi> we muſt be ſo Civil to him, as to ſuppoſe, that he doth not Believe the Eſſence of God to be one Intire Indiviſible Eſſence; which I do the more readily ſuppoſe, becauſe it's ſo Common for <hi>Tritheiſts</hi> to do ſo.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus theſe <hi>Pinczovians,</hi> vid. <hi>Liſmani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Gregorius Pauli, Ochinus, Statorius, Stancarus, Alciatus, &amp;c.</hi> their <hi>Partizans,</hi> did not only ſet up <hi>Tritheiſm</hi> with a Deſign to bring in the <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> Hereſie, but formed themſelves into ſundry Shapes, and were unwearied in their Attempts, firſt to turn the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> into <hi>Three diſtinct Eſſences,</hi> inſinuate an <hi>Inequality</hi> amongſt them, aſcribing to the Father a <hi>Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;</hi> and then bring the Deity of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit into Doubt, and make the Lord Chriſt a <hi>ſubordinate God;</hi> and thus eſtabliſh their <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Learned Doctor</hi> therefore, who hath confuted this <hi>Pinczovian</hi> Hereſie of <hi>Three diſtinct Eſſences in the Trinity,</hi> deſerves greatly from the Church of God; For, by turning his Strength againſt the Notion of <hi>Three diſtinct Infinite Eſſences, Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Minds</hi> he hath taken an
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104460:91"/>Effectual Courſe to break thoſe <hi>Socinian</hi> Meaſures which were moſt likely to expoſe the bleſſed Trinity, and prepare the Minds of many to take in their <hi>

                  <p>When the old <hi>Socinian</hi> Game is Playing over again, and ſome who pretend a Zeal for the <hi>Trinity</hi> walk in the ſame Path, and plead for <hi>Three diſtinct Eſſences,</hi> as the <hi>Italian Hereticks</hi> heretofore did, it is time for the Orthodox to look to themſelves: They cannot be too cautious in a matter of ſuch Conſequence; and what Perſons ſoever are induſtrious in their Endeavours to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this Doctrine of <hi>Three Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> are juſtly ſuſpected: Eſpecially ſince it is in a caſe where <hi>Solemn Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sacred Subſcriptions,</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> have been uſed only as a Blind to delude the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.<note place="margin">Reſpond. ad Comp.

                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit he is Poſitive, <q>That the Three Perſons are Three diſtinct Real <hi>Entia,</hi> or <hi>Beings,</hi> and that it is a Contradiction, that any thing ſhould truly Exiſt that had not its <hi>Proper Eſſence.</hi> It is therefore manifeſt, (ſaith he) that in the Trinity there are diſtinct Things; That no one can deny thus much, unleſs he doth with <hi>Praxea</hi> and <hi>Sabellius</hi> hold only <hi>Three Names,</hi> or <hi>Reſpects</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his Notion; which, notwithſtanding his Solemn Proteſtations of adhering unto the Orthodox Faith, he did his uttermoſt to propagate; he himſelf, as I have already proved, in the 70th.

                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the Methods which the <hi>Foreign Socinians</hi> have taken to expoſe the Trinity and Propagate their Hereſies; and whoever will conſult the Writings of our <hi>Engliſh Gentlemen,</hi> who are their <hi>Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi> will ſee, that there are a Set of Men amongſt us, who have, in Imitation of the <hi>Italian Hereticks,</hi> entered into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination to bring into contempt the ſame Bleſſed Truths, after the ſame manner their Predeceſſors have done.</p>

                  <p>BY what hath been hitherto aſſerted of the <hi>Engliſh Socinians,</hi> it is apparent, that whatever their Religion is, they are not prepar'd, as yet, for that <hi>Concord,</hi> as to be able to Compoſe, and Publiſh an Exact Scheme of it; but do they bend their Strength rather to tear up old Foundations, covering themſelves in ſuch a manner under Generals, that it's Impoſſible to ſind out what they would in Particular be at.

                     <q>In this Diſpute <hi>Tradelius</hi> arguing <hi>againſt the Socinian Notion, ſaid, That in his Opinion, if the Holy Spirit be not God, ſeeing every Thing that is, is either a Creator, or his Creature, he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be his Creature.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To him <hi>Oſtorodius</hi> thus replied. 1. <q>Tis one thing to ſay, that an Abſurdity flows from ſuch a Man's Notion; another to ſay, that this Man holds the Abſurdity: For Doctor <hi>Tradelius</hi> doth not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw from what I hold, that the Holy Spirit is a <hi>Creature,</hi> but ſaith Categorically, that I am of Opinion, That the Holy Ghoſt is a Creature: A thing, that never came into my Mind: For on the contrary I affirm, that if the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> be the Power of God, he is not a <hi>Creature;</hi> for the <hi>Power</hi> of God is not Created. (2) I further ſay, that tho' the Holy Spirit be not God 'twill not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow, that he is a Creature; for that Maxim, <hi>Omne quod Creator non eſt, eſt Creatura,</hi> is Uncertain; For the Juſtice, Love, Grace and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Attributes of God, are not <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures,</hi> nor are they <hi>God</hi> in that ſenſe <hi>Tradelius</hi> will have the Holy Spirit to be God.</q>

                     </gap> covered by <hi>Oſtorodius</hi> his Alluſion to the Attributes of God; for tho' they are not <hi>God</hi> in the Senſe <hi>Tradelius</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt is God, that is, they are not God Perſonally, yet they are Eſſentially, and are Infinite; and whatever is Infinite is God: Infinite Juſtice is God, and yet not many Gods but One, becauſe there can be but One Infinite.</p>
                  <p>If then the Holy Ghoſt be the <hi>Power</hi> of God, it is either <hi>Finite,</hi> or <hi>Infinite:</hi> If Finite, it can't be Eternal, it muſt have a Beginning, receive its being from another, and be a <hi>Creature;</hi> If <hi>Infinite,</hi> it is <hi>God;</hi> or, ſomewhat <hi>beſides God</hi> is Infinite, that is to ſay, there are <hi>Two Infinites</hi> the One God, the other not, which to our underſtandings is Contradiction all over.</p>
                  <p>How they can come off, I cannot ſee, eſpecially conſidering another Opinion of theirs, which is, That tho' it be a Sin to Worſhip the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet it's not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to do ſo.</p>

But thus much he doth, by affirming that there is ſo cloſe an Union between the Holy Ghoſt, and the moſt High God; that the giving
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104460:96"/>Divine Worſhip to him, cannot be either <hi>Impious</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> And in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what <hi>Meiſner</hi> urged, from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the Divine Properties to the Holy Ghoſt, in Proving him to be God; he turns it all off, by ſaying, That doth not Evince the Holy Ghoſt to be a Perſon, but it is ſufficient to my Purpoſe, that they Acknowledge the Holy Ghoſt to be <hi>as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as Infinite,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> as the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God are, ſeeing hereby they muſt either own him to be God; or that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſides God is Infinite.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As they ſay the Holy Ghoſt is neither a Creature nor God, ſo on the other hand, they make Chriſt to be but a <hi>Creature;</hi> and yet to be <hi>God</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They affirm Jeſus Chriſt to be a <hi>True God; True,</hi> in Oppoſition to the Falſe Gods of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are indeed Falſe Gods, becauſe they are Gods without a Deity: A God without a Deity is a falſe God becauſe he wants Infinite Perfection; a true God then hath Infinite Perfections, and therefore muſt be the moſt High God, except there are Perfections more High than what are <hi>Infinite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thus much they Deny, tho' Chriſt be a true God, yet he is not the <hi>Moſt High God.</hi> He is but a <hi>Subordinate</hi> God in his Eſſence. This then is their Notion, Chriſt is a True Subordinate God, <hi>i. e.</hi> A True God whoſe Perfections are Infinite; a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate God in his Eſſence whoſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be but <hi>Finite,</hi> and therefore can be no God at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again,</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:104460:96"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt is, they ſay, God, on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's giving him Abſolute Dominion over all things, with a Power, and Knowledge, whereby he knoweth the Diſtreſſes of all, and is able to Relieve the Diſtreſſed; But, ſeeing Nothing, ſhort of <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> can know, and Relieve, and theſe together with abſolute <hi>Dominion,</hi> are Eſſential Properties of the Moſt High God, How comes it to paſs, that Chriſt is not the moſt High God? Here are the Eſſential Properties of ſuch a God, and yet no ſuch God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of their Myſteries. The Holy Ghoſt is an Eternal Omnipotent. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create Being, but not God. He is neither a Creator, nor a Creature, but an Omnipotent Somewhat, different from Both: Increate or Unoriginated Omnipotence is not ſufficient to evince the Eternal Spirit to be God; but a Derived Omnipotence is enough to make a Creature to be a True God. Unoriginated Omnipotence is not Reaſon enough for the adoring the Eternal Spirit; but <hi>Derived</hi> Omnipotence is a good Ground for Rendring Divine Worſhip to a Creature. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you ſee, are the <hi>Grand Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiators;</hi> for they can <hi>Tranſubſtantiate</hi> a Creature into a <hi>True God,</hi> and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Creature, they can Transfer the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Properties from one being to another; and each Being remain the ſame it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranſlation; They can Order and Diſpoſe of the Divine Properties in ſuch a Way, that they ſhall be inſufficient to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104460:97"/>him a True God, in whom they were from all Eternity, and yet be Powerful enough to make him, in whom they were not two Thouſand Years ago, to be a True God. Whether theſe are Real Myſteries, or Real Contradictions, let the Prudent judge.</p>
                  <p>I will not treat theſe Over-Wiſe Men with that Scurrilous Language they do the Myſteries of the Holy Trinity; But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exaggeration I will proceed to Examine what they ſay of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>God the Father</hi> is only the moſt High God, is their Aſſertion; of whom they have nevertheleſs form'd ſuch an Idea as fails of Infinite Perfections. So that if we purſue their Notion of a Deity to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Length, we muſt at laſt ſit down amongſt the <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing this, I do in Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Common ſentiments of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, averr, that what Being ſoever is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of an Infinite Perfection is not, cannot be God. The Eſſential Properties belong to the Divine Nature, including Infinite Perfection; that being which is deſtitute thereof, wants what is Eſſential to God, and cannot be the True God.</p>
                  <p>If then the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny any one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfection to belong to their God, it muſt be acknowledged, that he wants what is eſſential unto God, and is not God. And that they Deny thus much, is Evident, from the Notion they frame of his Eternity, and their Rejecting his <hi>Immenſity</hi> and <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

                  <p>Our Author is pleaſed to <hi>challenge</hi> Us, to ſhew, that there is any other Doctrine; upon our Aſſent to which, or Disbelief of it, Men were pronounced Believers or Unbelievers.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104460:103"/>But I crave leave to tell him, amongſt other Doctrines, that of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Divinity is one. If he will conſult <hi>John</hi> 5.18, 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He'll find it to be clearly Revealed, and ſufficiently proved by the Lord Jeſus Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the Belief of his being God, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Father, is ſo neceſſary, that without it, we can't be pronounced Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</p>
                  <p>The Holy Evangeliſt, in the Account he gives of the Diſcourſe that was between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> expreſly declares, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought to kill <hi>Jeſus;</hi> becauſe he ſaid, that <hi>God was his Father,</hi> making <hi>Himſelf equal with God.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, the Lord Jeſus went on to the Proofs, aſſuring them, that His doing the ſame Works which the Father doth, doth evince him to be God, <hi>equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> adding, that the Father hath ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment unto the Son, that <hi>all Men ſhould Honour the Son, even as they Honour the Father:</hi> That is, with the ſame Honour, Worſhip, and Adoration: For, he <hi>that Honoureth</hi> not <hi>the</hi> Son, <hi>Honoureth</hi> not <hi>the Father,</hi> which <hi>has ſent him;</hi> which Words do plainly ſhew, that 'tis the Will of the Father, That we believe his Son <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to be God, equal with himſelf. For a rendring the <hi>ſame Honour</hi> to the Son which is due unto the Father, carrieth in it, an Aſcription of thoſe Eſſential Perfections of God to him, which make him to be God, equal with the Father; which cannot be lawfully done by any, but ſuch as believe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104460:104"/>him to be ſo; as appears not only from the Nature of the thing, but from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. where it's ſaid, that we can't call, or give Divine Honour to him, in whom we have not believed. If then <hi>Honouring</hi> the Son as we <hi>Honour</hi> the Father be ſo neceſſary a Duty, that they who neglect it do not <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> the Father, a believing the Son to be God, in the ſame Senſe the Father is God, is ſo neceſſary, as a believing the Father to be God; which is ſo very neceſſary, that on the Disbelief of it, Men were pronounced Unbelievers</p>
